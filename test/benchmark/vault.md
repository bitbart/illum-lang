# Vault

Vaults are a security mechanism to prevent cryptocurrency from being immediately withdrawn by 
an adversary who has stolen the owner's private key. 

To create the vault, the owner specifies a recovery key (distinct from the primary owner key), 
which can be used to cancel a withdraw request, and a wait time that has to elapse between 
a withdraw request and the actual currency transfer to the chosen recipient.

Once the contract has been created, anyone can deposit native cryptocurrency in the vault through 
an external transaction.

The contract can be in one of two states:
- IDLE: the vault is waiting for a withdraw request;
- REQ: the owner has issued a withdraw request that has not been finalized yet. In this state, the owner 
can choose to finalize the request or to cancel it. Finalization can only happen after the wait time 
has passed since the request. During the wait time, the request can be cancelled by using the recovery key.

Concretely, the keys are represented as addresses: requiring that an action can only be performed 
by someone knowing a certain key corresponds to requiring that a method is called by the corresponding address.
